Overview
This project examines the achievment gap in the Louisiana education system. Several potential metrics could potentially be explored to study the achivement gap
including standardized state testing scores for elementary and middle school students, ACT scores for high school students, high school graduation rates, access
to enrichment programs, etc... The first metric examined will be 3-8th grade LEAP scores.

Questions
Is the achievment gap in Louisiana closing over time?
If there are changes in the gap, what policies have been enacted to affect those changes?

The Data
The Data comes from the Louisiana State Department of Education. The data divided by subgroups for examining equity issues goes back to 2014 (depending on the metric).
